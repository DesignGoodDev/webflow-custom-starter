## Webflow - Custom Code

This repo keeps track of custom code for this Webflow CMS project.

In the future, this may be deployed with a CDN, but for now these get pasted into Webflow custom code fields, either globally or per-page.

All Javascript here is "vanilla", in hopeful anticipation of Webflow making jQuery optional someday (and for the fun of it).
